Micronutrient Treatment Dataset for Machine Learning Analysis of Italian Ryegrass

Description

This dataset contains micronutrient treatment–response data for Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum), structured for machine learning modeling, validation, and reproducibility analysis. The dataset captures the effects of sulfur (S), zinc (Zn), and boron (B), applied individually and in combination, on key growth, yield, and forage quality traits.

The dataset was generated following experimentally established treatment-wise response patterns and expanded to support robust computational analysis. Values reflect realistic biological variation expected under rainfed field conditions and preserve physiologically consistent nutrient–response relationships.
